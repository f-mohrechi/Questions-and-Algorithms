## Log String Properties of an Object

Write a function `showProperties` that takes an object `obj` as an argument. The function should iterate over the properties of the object and log the property name and its value to the console, but only if the value is a string.

For example, if the function is called with the following object:

```javascript
showProperties({
  name: "John",
  age: 30,
  city: "fjwpq",
});
```

It should log:

name: John
city: fjwpq
