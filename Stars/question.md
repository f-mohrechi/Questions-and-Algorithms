## Question

Write a function `showStars` that takes a number `num` as an argument and prints a pattern of asterisks (`*`) in the console. The pattern should be a triangle with `num` rows, where the first row has one asterisk, the second row has two asterisks, and so on, up to the `num`th row.

For example, if `num` is `5`, the output should be:

- \*\*
  ***
  ***
  ***
