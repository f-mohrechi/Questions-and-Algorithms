## Even or Odd

Write a function `showNum` that takes a number `num` as an argument and logs all the numbers from 0 to `num` (inclusive) along with whether they are even or odd.

The function should use a `for` loop to iterate from 0 to `num`, and for each number, it should determine whether it's even or odd using the modulus operator `%`. If the number is even, it should log the number followed by the string `"even"`. If the number is odd, it should log the number followed by the string `"odd"`.

For example, if `showNum(5)` is called, the output should be:
0 even
1 odd
2 even
3 odd
4 even
5 odd
