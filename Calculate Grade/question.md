# Question

Write a function `calculate` that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a letter grade based on the average of the numbers in the array. The grading scale is as follows:

- Average <= 59: "F"
- 60 <= Average <= 69: "D"
- 70 <= Average <= 79: "C"
- 80 <= Average <= 89: "B"
- 90 <= Average <= 100: "A"

For example, if the input array is `[90, 90, 90]`, the function should return "A".
