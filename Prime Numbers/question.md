## Print Prime Numbers

Write a function `showPrimes` that takes a number `num` as an argument and prints all prime numbers up to `num`.

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

For example, if `num` is `10`, the function should print:
2
3
5
7
